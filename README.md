This project analyzes clinic appointment, patient, and billing data to support operational decision-making.
## Business Questions Answered

This dashboard was designed to help clinic managers answer the following questions:

- How many appointments are being scheduled, and how is this changing over time?
- What percentage of appointments result in no-shows?
- How much revenue is generated, and how does it relate to treatments?
- What is the age and gender distribution of patients?
- Which patient groups are most common at the clinic?


## Key Insights

- The clinic recorded a total of 200 appointments during the analysis period, with noticeable fluctuations across months, indicating seasonal patterns in patient visits.
- Approximately 26% of appointments resulted in no-shows, highlighting a significant opportunity to improve scheduling efficiency and patient follow-up processes.
- Total revenue generated was 551.25K, driven primarily by completed treatments, demonstrating the financial impact of appointment attendance.
- The largest proportion of patients falls within the 18–35 age group, followed by 36–55, suggesting the clinic primarily serves a young to middle-aged population.
- Male patients represent a higher share of total patients compared to female patients, indicating potential demographic trends in service usage.
